              My team was tasked by our client, Daniel Barret, to develop a functioning model to simulate an automated industry warehouse inventory system. 
              The workspace had an existing <a href="https://new.abb.com/products/3HAC020536-001/irb-140" className="underline">IRB 140 Robot</a> by  
              ABB and a steel frame fitted with racks to house the materials being stored or retrieved. A 3-axis movement tray was installed on the storage 
              frame using steel wires, frames, and motors.

              The machine was connected to a 14" HMI display which was designed to control the ASRS with a user-friendly interface in mind.
              It is vital to have every element be quickly identified and understood by any user, indifferent of skill level. Thus, it is ideal
              to create a visual display that is simple yet informative to the user.

                My teammates and I began by identifying problems and brainstorming as many solutions as we could come up with,
                no matter how significant one may appear over the other.

                We wanted to overhaul the existing <i>tray</i>, <i>gripper</i>, <i>storage rack</i>, <i>delivery station</i>, and <i>tray extractor</i> designs.
                The original ASRS had functioning moving parts, but only aluminum trays which could not be picked up. We were looking to implement 3D printed components
                for the tray, grippers, and tray extractors, as these could be useful methods of prototyping the designs we came up with.

              <p className="text-2xl mt-4">
                Some of the sketched out designs needed to work in conjunction with others. For instance, the first tray design would work with the first gripper
                and storage rack designs because the tray extended out a hook to be grabbed from above. Other tray designs may have necessitated the grippers to
                pick
